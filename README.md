# Perspective Projection Project

The Perspective Projection project is an interactive demonstration of matrix transformations and linear algebra concepts in computer graphics. The primary objective of this project is to showcase how 3D objects can be projected onto a 2D screen using perspective projection matrices. Additionally, the project allows users to explore various transformations  using keyboard controls.

## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of linear algebra and its crucial role in computer graphics. We utilize matrices for rotation, scale, and translation to manipulate the position and orientation of 3D objects on a 2D screen. The main highlight of the project is the implementation of perspective projection, offering an insightful comparison with regular projection views.


## Usage

To run the Perspective Projection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ashenoy64/PerspectiveProjection.git
```


2. Navigate to the cloned project directory:

```
cd PerspectiveProjection
```

3. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the project:

```
python main.py
```


## Keyboard Controls

The project provides the following keyboard controls:

- Numpad keys 8, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9: Local rotation along the x, y, z axes respectively.
- W, S, A, D, Q, E: Local translation along the x, y, z axes respectively.
- I, K, J, L, U, O: Local scaling along the x, y, z axes respectively.
- Numpad *: Add a new cube to the scene.
- Numpad -: Animate the cubes.
- Numpad /: Toggle between perspective and projection views.
